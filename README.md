Simple VHDL utilities for Altera MAX7000

These VHDL files were developed during the Circuitry and Electronics System Desgin course (DCSE in spanish) (2012).
The FPGA used was a Altera UP2 education board and Altera Quartus II sw.

The goal of the 2 modules above is:
* Functions generator
  1. Sine
  2. Triangle
  3. Sawtooth
* Voltmeter

In addition, a module for displaying the measured values was developed too.


These file were imported from local repo.
